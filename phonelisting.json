Never buy an AT&T unlocked phones, because they really are not, especially to use overseas, they will let you down. They should refund all my money back because it was misrepresentation.

        "comment": "I really wanted to love this phone. I loved the windows 8.1 home screen with live tiles and Cortana was excellent. The phone itself was built pretty solid. However, the cons far outweigh the pros. I had to do a hard reset on this phone THREE TIMES within the span of two weeks. First, it would not connect to wifi. Secondly, it kept rebooting itself (one day, it rebooted itself TEN TIMES.) Lastly, the phone was frozen in time one morning. The phone eventually shut off one day and would never turn back on. The phone completely died on me. I don't know if this was a software problem or if it was the phone itself, but I am so disappointed and will never buy a Windows phone again."

But then I missed the Windows phone OS. I missed Cortana, the live tiles, the here maps, the am/fm radio, the rolodex style app list and contacts list and the dedicated camera button. So, I bought this Lumia 625 from this seller. To my pleasant surprise, it came with an orange housing as well. I thought I was only getting a white phone. I was able to update it to WP 8.1, not too easily but after trying for 4-5 times, I got it. I bought a prepaid sim card from AT&T and loaded it up with a $25 monthly charge. The camera isn't so good but that's the only thing negative about this phone. I also missed the 4.7 inch screen that I had with my Galaxy S3 before switching to the 1520 then to G3."

        "comment": "This phone is absolutely fantastic for the price, but some potential buyers may not be fully aware of what to expect when it arrives.First off this phone is actually an unlocked AT&T Lumia 900, so there will be AT&T branding on the front. This means that the original packaging will already be opened, as the seller needs to manually unlock the phone before they ship it to you. This does NOT mean that it is a used phone. In order to be able to use non-AT&T sim cards, it is necessary for the seller to contact AT&T to receive an unlock code that frees it from the AT&T network. In my order, there was hardly any sign that it was handled at all, except for maybe a little finger print on the front glass. All the essential documents from AT&T and Nokia were inside the box, as well as a SIM ejector tool and a power cable.As is stated in the description, this phone will work on any HSPA/WCDMA 850/900/1900/2100 MHz/Quad-band data network and any GSM/GPRS/EDGE: 850/900/1800/1900 MHz cellular network, which in turn opens it for carriers in Europe and some in Asia. For US providers, there are currently only 2 major carriers that have GSM networks: AT&T and T-Mobile. There are other smaller carriers that offer services, but they utilize AT&T and T-Mobile towers in their coverage. These carriers include Straight Talk, Red Pocket Mobile, i Wireless, etc., and offer really affordable prepaid plans that I myself utilize. T-Mobile also offers a $30 a month prepaid plan that is rather reasonable.Unfortunately this phone will not work on any CDMA networks, which rules out Verizon, Sprint and US Cellular. For more information on the differences between CDMA and GSM networks, PCMAG.com has a fairly easy to read article explaining the differences between the two.Now onto the phone itself. I must say that I love this phone. It has a fairly decent Amoled 4.3 inch display, with a resolution of only 800x480. In our modern age of 1280\u00d7720 and above screens that may seem rather paltry. While using the phone normally it is looks as good as any other screen, but when watching YouTube videos it's lack of pixels becomes apparent. For me I use my iPad and laptop for watching videos so it doesn't matter to me all that much, but for others it may be a deal breaker.The build of the phone is absolutely fantastic. It is made of a solid polycarbonate body that is very resistant to scratches, with a screen made of Corning Gorilla Glass. Needless to say, it is very sturdy. The screen also seems to attract a large number of fingerprints as well, and for some reason is not all that easy to clean off. There is even a YouTube video where a hammer, saw and nail are taken to it and it comes up with little or no damage. The only thing on the phone that seems to be somewhat damageable is the metal piece around the camera lens. After less than 24 hours, there were already little scratches visible. For me I don't really care too much about it, but for others it may be really irritating.The camera itself is 8 megapixels with a Carl Zeiss lens, and it is just ok. There are certainly better phone cameras out there, with the iPhone 5 and Lumia 920 blowing it out of the water. For me it works best outdoors, as indoor shots tend to have more noise for whatever reason.This phone uses Windows Phone 7.5 Mango, so it is not the brand new Windows Phone 8. Sad thing about this phone is that it will never receive an update to Windows Phone 8. The hardware is just unable to fully handle the new OS. Instead it will receive Windows Phone 7.8, which gives it some Windows Phone 8 functionality, such as resizable tiles and the like. But apps in the future will cater just to Windows Phone 8, meaning that those with 7.8 and below will be left out in the cold with newer apps. Again, this isn't a deal breaker for me but for many it will be.One of the things that attracted me to this phone is Nokia Drive. Unlike most smartphone map applications, it does not require data in order to run. Before you set out on a trip you download fully detailed maps onto your phone, and then the built in GPS chip is used to map your location on the map. You can even download state or country specific maps, so you save space by not downloading the entire US map pack. All of this is done without data usage, which is great if you are traveling abroad. Oh, and it is completely free of charge. For travelers like myself, this is an awesome feature. I am also a student, so having a mobile version of Microsoft Office in my pocket is absolutely wonderful, for it allows me to edit documents while on the go.Overall this is a fantastic phone but definitely shows its age (close to one year). However, its awesome build quality as well as fantastic applications for travelers made it a must have for me. It fits my needs well, but potential buyers will need to consider whether it will work well for them."

That may be true but I adjusted the settings to 200 for the ISO and 1 for the exposure and the pictures have improved greatly. The simplicity of this phone makes it easy to learn and pick up for anyone. Its a breeze finding things on this phone, no lag, great UI. The live tiles are easy to use and multi-task through. And this phone is blazing fast! enough said."

However not sure why NEW phone came with Android 5 and end user was supposed to upgrade to Android 6 just after opening the box. Since I am not a big expert on OS and its compatibility with apps, I did not want to change things on a NEW phone, but it kept bugging me that a upgrade was due. I did that upgrade spending hours on that -- luckily it went smoothly. However I am very DISAPPOINTED to see that CAMERA --> Advance settings --> like ISO settings have just disappeared. There may be other things in other Apps that may have got impacted with this OS upgrade, but don't them as yet."

Solid phone. Mine came with a screen saver which is now about at the end of it's life. I use this phone in the field for a highway contractor so it sees plenty of dust and has been dropped at least a dozen times.Placed a tone of music on 32 GB SD Card. If I skip songs it might lag for a few seconds but that has more to do with the card being too full. The storage manager pops up and I clean off the junk and the music player works fine. The FM radio is awesome although I really don't use it often it's nice to have if there were a major earthquake or something else that could take out cell service. Battery lasts over a day for me put I really don't use it much at work. The camera is awesome, might not be as good as the latest iPhone but I saved $500. Camera has a professional setting which you can change the exposure, white balance., etc. The pictures look great on social media posts."

Have added 400 songs I'm still have 4gig to go on memory.hotspot and wifi works perfect.after researching just about all phone this 1 seems like the best deal.Enjoy it. We do."

Still wouldn't charge then finally plugged it into my ihone and it started charging. The phone was completely dead when I got it and has finally come on so I know it at least works how well I'm not sure as I am waiting for it to charge completely. It did not come in a box like they said but that's ok I already have an iPhone box as I bought mine new for $1.06 when I signed on to my 3 year contract. At that time the phones had just come out. Ill update my listing once I mess with the phone. There were light scratches on the back but nothing gastly just normal wear."

I gotta say, I'm very happy with this purchase. It wasn't hard to set up the sim's card into the device. It came in the mail like it was brand new with the original packaging and everything. I love texting and calling my friends and family with it. I have experienced the white screen of death, but I restarted it without a second thought and everything has been fine ever since. I haven't really experience any serious heating problems and I've played some high capacity games on it while being plugged in. It does get rather warm in the hands, but it wasn't enough to be uncomfortable for me. The main reason why I got this phone was because I wanted an easier and more convenient way to call and text my friends and family. The phone I had before was a flip phone without a proper keyboard. This does what I want and so much more. For $115, I got a really good deal and I'm happy to say that I'll be using this until my dad stops paying for the contract or it does die out on me. Just to let those who have flip phones know, the iPhone 3GS can PREVENT data being used when you're not on that plan. The flip phone that I had would take me onto the web without warning me first and that caused my phone to be charged a few extra dollars for just a few seconds of being on the internet. At least now, I don't have to worry about those slippages because I can only use data when i'm using wi-fi.I don't really have any complaints for this phone because it's more then what I want in an phone, but as an Apple product, I have to say that the screen really takes a miss. I'm so spoiled by Retina Display on my iPod Touch 5g, that it bugs me when everything is in low resolution. When comparing watching videos or pictures, it's just ain't the same. It's good when I'm bored at college, but for casual use, it's not that great from today's standards.It's a little bulky, but I kind of like it that way. It gives it a feel to it and it doesn't slip out of my hands unlike the new iPod Touch.Seeing that I got the white screen of death on the second day scared me. I'm hoping that wasn't the reason why the seller sold it to me.Summery:Pros:Great for a phone and great for texting.Has great cellular connection.Satisfying battery life.Can handle playing games without taking too much heat.Can prevent using data on cellular network unlike my old flip phone.Cons:Poor screen quality compared to today's standard for Apple products.Sort of bulky, but having some weight is a pro for me.White screen of death on the second day of using it."

When i googled i saw people having same problems. I just found out , one of my colleauge had literally exchanged this phone from the carrier 4 times. So HTC has real bad problem with this phone."

        "comment": "Tengo una semana de estar utilizando este tel\u00e9fono celular. Es mi primer Nokia y al principio fue un poco frustrante por que no sab\u00eda donde buscar las aplicaciones, yo estaba acostumbrado a los celulares Sony Ericksson y me sent\u00eda muy c\u00f3modo con ellos pero por las caracter\u00edsticas que presentaba el N97 su gran cantidad de memoria ser de tecnolog\u00eda 3G, los buenos comentarios que hab\u00eda escuchado y por precio decid\u00ed comprarlo en lugar de un Sony Ericksson.Como mencion\u00e9 al principio me frustr\u00e9 pero era mas por desconocimiento que otra cosa por ejemplo le instal\u00e9 el navegador Opra mini ya que el navegador que el trae no me gustaba pero cuando me conectaba a Internet lo hac\u00eda atravez del navegador predeterminado y yo no sab\u00eda que ten\u00eda que entrar a aplicaciones y de ah\u00ed accesar a Opra. Pero poco a poco fui encontrandole las aplicaciones y debo decir que ahora estoy muy contento.Las cosas buenas de este celular:1) Esteticamente es muy lindo, la resoluci\u00f3n de la pantalla hace que las im\u00e1genes se vean muy n\u00edtidas.2)La c\u00e1mara y el video no tienen nada que envidiarle a un artefacto dedicado es decir a una c\u00e1mara digital o a una videocamara, las fotos son muy bien logradas y el flash realmente funciona en lugares oscuras se pueden apreciar perfectamente los detalles.3) La conexi\u00f3n a Internet es muy buena, gracias al zoom puedes agrandar o disminuir la im\u00e1genes las cuales se aprecian muy bien, logicamente hay p\u00e1ginas que por ser tan grandes no se observaran como en la computadora, pero en realidad la navegaci\u00f3n es placentera siempre y cuando no tengas que estar digitando algo.4) Conectarte a las redes sociales o a tu correo electr\u00f3nico esta a un click de distancia y como dige antes en segundos y puedes leer archivos en formato de word excel o PDF. Es decir si no estas cerca a de una computadora no hay ning\u00fan problema te sacar\u00e1 del apuro, aunque repito la experiencia aun no es como con la computadora pero ese es un problema en todos los tel\u00e9fono inteligentes. Yo reviso mis estados de cuenta, puedo hacer una compra en Amazon pagar recibos entrar al banco hacer transacciones, etc, etc.5) El tel\u00e9fono es robusto se ve fuerte aunque aun no se ha llevado ning\u00fan golpe6) Tiene todas las funciones de los tel\u00e9fonos convencionales pero a diferencia de otros estas realmente cumplen por ejemplo si tienes una grabadora tu esperas que cuando des click esta realmente grabe y esta lo hace, yo he tenido telefonos que cuando quise usar la grabadora esta simplemente no funcion\u00f3. Puedes vivar con ello pero da c\u00f3lera que una aplicaci\u00f3n no funcione como debiera.Pero bueno no todo es perfecto y lo que no me gust\u00f3 es lo inc\u00f3modo que resulta a veces el teclado qwerty a veces cuando estoy navegando si por alguna raz\u00f3n tengo que digitar algo puedo desplegar texto en pantalla pero en otras ocasiones esta caracter\u00edstica no esta disponible y me obliga a usar el teclado y no se si es la falta de costumbre pero soy mucho mas diestro con las teclas de un tel\u00e9fono que con este tipo de teclado y me demoro mucho por lo que me resulta engorroso. Pero bueno no se talvez dentro de unos meses ya me halla acostumbrado.Pero por lo dem\u00e1s creo que son mucho mas las satisfacciones imaginense pueden utilizar este tel\u00e9fono como un GPS yo en la particular no lo uso por que ya tengo un Garmin que es una belleza y al cual ya estoy super acostumbrado pero bueno esta es una aplicaci\u00f3n que bien vale la pena utilizar si esta disponible. En sintes\u00eds le digo comprelo no se va a arrepentir, a y se me olvidaba la pantalla t\u00e1ctil funciona a las mil maravillas esta era una de mis principales dudas, pero me di cuenta que si funciona y excelentemente bien, el secreto es calibrarla la pantalla a tu gusto, si gustas de apretar mucho el l\u00e1piz pues as\u00ed la calibras a mi me gustan los trazos suaves y as\u00ed la calibr\u00e9 y apenas dejo caer el l\u00e1piz y la funci\u00f3n se aplica. As\u00ed es que es una buena inversi\u00f3n la \u00fanica raz\u00f3n por la que no le d\u00ed cinco estrellas fue por la raz\u00f3n del teclado por lo dem\u00e1s no hay quejas."

        "comment": "This is an expensive phone with three major problems for which I gave it a two-star. First, the reception is much weaker comparing to my old phone (Motorola Ming). Once the reception is lost, it could take a minute or more for you to be able to see some signal bars appeared again. Second, the connection is another issue for this cell phone. It gives a lot of \"connection error\" messages, and I have experienced way more call drops since I changed to this cell phone. Also, the home screen rotates easily from vertical to horizontal, but it doesn't do the same backward. I have to shake the phone with some strength for the home screen rotate back to vertical. Overall, I am very disappointed with Nokia N97, but since I paid a good amount of money for it, I have to stick with it for a while."

        "comment": "I am very satisfied with this phone. Works great on AT&T 3G & EDGE networks. The Ovi Store is a great app store that allows you to download apps, themes, and other content for your Nokia phone safely. I would not recommend installing any apps that are not through the Ovi Store. I did and ended up having to reset my phone, losing some of the content that came originally on the phone. Great phone, though. Only drawback I have noticed is that depending on how you hold the phone, sometimes your voice comes across muffled to the person you are on the phone with."

Besides this inconvenience, the N97 is really a great phone with nice features and a much easier to use touchscreen when compared to the Iphone."
